As you have learned, sprints provide the rhythm for the team. They create opportunities for you to get feedback more quickly, encourage team collaboration, and provide greater focus. They are like mini-projects with their own planning, execution, delivery, closing, and  retrospective. 

By planning sprints using work management tools, teams can have full clarity on Sprint Plans, milestones, launch dates, and Backlog, with work efforts and communication together in one place. In this reading, you’ll discover how to plan a sprint using a work management tool. This example will showcase these skills using Asana; however, you can also apply these concepts to other tools!

## **Add a custom field for sprints**

In the activity [_Create a Sprint Plan and Sprint Backlog_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-project-management/peer/YA7VH/activity-create-a-sprint-plan-and-sprint-backlog)

, you planned the first Sprint for the Virtual Verde project. Here, you will learn how to recreate planning that Sprint using Asana. In this reading, each item in the Virtual Verde Backlog will be prioritized and scheduled for an upcoming sprint. To do that, you can add a custom field for Sprints, which will allow you to easily find out which Sprint each task is scheduled for. 

You can open the Customize menu by clicking the button in the top right corner.

![Customize menu pane opened. There are options to edit, add, or upgrade elements.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/FRt9Gp7ITousIarhQNBp0Q_875400ca17b147e398c109ffeb0b01f1_AD_4nXd8xddqgftVgQa1UedInnJpIn1SnD0U-FAoUTGR302ZZWdOA7E0fd6bETVUsawkCKZsp6w9aS_hcFJKZBvObaNUWJd0vKp4xK_c-jWeORlqlsx_un7PEvZ4qzlQE0jQ5nrkIZqGrwKidaDffXM8W-j-HWHY?expiry=1748044800000&hmac=TFTxN5h-JGtRkm36HtXiWMzihksRjlHadlAUXWuyEtU)

You can select Fields from the Add section to add a Sprint field. You can also add options for the Current Sprint and the Next Field in order to plan ahead for future sprints, too.

![Add Field pop-up menu with details for a new Sprint field, including options for the current sprint and next sprint.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/l6cJmxj4TaWT-BmjHHXfZQ_c1093b43e47d4845bf0110bf4cf7daf1_AD_4nXcIxDi_-Tx6w-U1cx75rXxk9hQ3dekCXRWoCSvBRxmemYA0pwJN_g8jt_oCFi9gnHJlrkbajNh6a_Dy-vBfmMOccH0h2ctLWZ9fpeh01vs2QW4h7EQUN_Lw5kTNikRFdS05d7nBVkjw9bZCNY9h84dyqNr3?expiry=1748044800000&hmac=suwcxTIhv5r8fRh3J0jEFODwcDD0KWGd53zKkuWibVw)

## **Assign items to the Sprint Backlog**

After creating the Sprint field, you can assign items to the Sprint Backlog for the first two Sprints. For this step, it’s recommended that you switch over to the list view, since it’s easier to see all your tasks at once. You can assign items to the Current Sprint or Next Sprint using the drop-downs in the Sprint column.

![A new Sprint column has been added. A drop down menu is open on a blank cell with options for Current and Next Sprint.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/FeXbJtSSTzSqzTE_iImoZQ_0fbf79683a7344a3a5f6e0bb73313bf1_AD_4nXfph9fCLRopuVWTHwbmYleJv5q4-DswSn1JgoeWDR3DJ95HrCMZ8_16MGdib5uSvQJ1B50bvv6MJJZWz3DZmSTGTnCKRWOhvlIXETXwyhlK_ErcXt7rZ_eNVYZUz94wz4eDd4vugu63aYZdARGqH2btM6xHqA?expiry=1748044800000&hmac=JtMd8xs1hHBE4_LKTLq0WSv2CX8H1zG12fgc_8i8oGE)

Finally, you can add a due date for the “Current Sprint” items under the “Due date” column
