## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will develop a list of takeaways and action items from a Sprint Retrospective. A Sprint Retrospective is one of the five main Sprint events and gives a chance for the Scrum Team to get together and discuss the work they just finished. Your task is to write an email to the Scrum Team recapping the Retrospective.

_**Note:**_ _Throughout this course, you will complete tasks normally done by others (like the Development Team or Product Owner). Even if you don’t perform them yourself, it is important that you understand these processes._

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

## Scenario

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/3ndhtjIJRu63YbYyCWbuvQ_df502b044167464ba7da6a39fb14199d_line-y.png?expiry=1748044800000&hmac=xrkKKOrJWb2BITS-ZpEzfksfbxb_rNdPWG4l5bWQIdY)

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step-instructions. 

The Virtual Verde team has completed the first Sprint based on the Backlog you created in the last activity, [_Create a Sprint Plan and Sprint Backlog_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-project-management/peer/YA7VH/activity-create-a-sprint-plan-and-sprint-backlog)

. The team also gathered for a Sprint Retrospective to go over what worked well during the Sprint, and what they want to change for the future. Your team reviewed each item from the Sprint, and discussed how the work went and how the team performed.

After the meeting, you took photos of the whiteboards your team created during the discussion, knowing you’d need the notes to reflect on team accomplishments and what to change for the future.

_**Note:**_ _Any team member can write Retrospective recaps. Even if you don't write them, this activity will help you recognize effective recap emails._

**Step 2: Review the whiteboard notes from the Sprint Retrospective**

Open the slide deck with your [whiteboard notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b6iXcfg_D_eVm1xC1WasWBioRSd9xvNhswJSSh6sMeM/template/preview)

 (click the link and select “Use Template” to make a copy in Google Slides or download the notes using the attachment below).  Then review the team’s successes, what worked well in terms of process and performance, and what issues you need to resolve for future Sprints.

The team used a **+/Δ** format for the discussion: They listed what went well under the **+** (or plus) heading, and listed roadblocks and things they want to change going forward under the **Δ** (or Delta) heading (**Δ** is the mathematical symbol for change).

**Step 3: Make a list of takeaways**

Make a list of 5-10 key takeaways from the whiteboard notes. These could be about team performance, tasks accomplished, workflow, communication, or anything else you discussed. 

For example, a note reading, _“Didn't truly understand the scope of this item,”_ could translate into the takeaway, _“Let’s review how we do our estimates next time, as we may not be accounting for the full scope.”_

**Step 4: Write a recap email to the Scrum Team**

Finally, compose an email recapping the meeting and listing the key takeaways. Be sure to include:

- **A Subject line**: It should be brief and describe the content of the message.
    
- **An Introduction**: Greet the team and explain why you are sending the email.
    
- **A Recap**: Summarize your thoughts on the retrospective. Were you pleased with how the meeting went? How much did the team accomplish?
    
- **Key takeaways**: List 5-10 key takeaways from the whiteboard notes. What went well with the Sprint? What issues need to be addressed before the next Sprint?
    
- **Next steps**: Wrap up the email and propose next steps.
    
- **A Closing**: Sign off with your name and title.
