As a recap, please read this overview of the Sprint taken directly from the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#the-sprint)




Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.

They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
    
- Quality does not decrease;
    
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
    
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.
    

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

**Step 2: Add the points capacity to the Sprint Backlog tab**

First, go to the **Sprint Backlog** tab. To add the points capacity:

- Find the **Sprints** section (toward the right side of the sheet).
    
- Under the **Current Sprint** column, add the total number of Story Points your team expects to complete in the upcoming Sprint.
    

**Step 3: Assign items from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog**

Now it’s time to assign Product Backlog items to your Sprint Backlog. Your goal is to maximize value and velocity without going over the team’s points capacity. If an item puts the team over 60 points, skip that one and add the next item that fits within the remaining capacity. Remember that you should focus on the Plant Care Initiatives epic first. You can include items from the Bonsai Trees epic _only_ if you have extra capacity.

To add items to your Sprint Backlog:

- Go to the **Product Backlog** tab.
    
- Find the **Value** column header and click the dropdown arrow. Select _Sort sheet Z → A._ This will bring the items with the highest value to the top.
    
- Assign Backlog items to the Current Sprint using the dropdowns in the **Sprint** column. When selecting stories for the Sprint, start at the top with the highest value items. Then assign items down the list until the number of Story Points assigned matches the team’s expected capacity. 
    
- To check the number of points assigned to the Current Sprint in Google Sheets, proceed to **Step 4**. To check your points in Excel, skip to **Step 5**. 
    

**Step 4: Check the points capacity in the Sprint Backlog tab (Google Sheets version)**

If you’re using Google Sheets, the Backlog items you assigned to the Current Sprint will automatically populate in the **Sprint Backlog** tab. The total number of Story Points from these items will appear next to **Points Assigned**. The total value will appear next to **Value Attributed**.

Check to make sure the number of Story points assigned fits the capacity for the Current Sprint. If the number is above or below capacity, try reassigning the Product Backlog items as needed. Once you are satisfied with your Sprint Backlog, skip to **Step 6**.

**Step 5: Check the points capacity in the Sprint Backlog tab (Excel version)**

If you’re using Excel, you will need to move the Product Backlog items to the Sprint Backlog manually:

- In the **Product Backlog** tab, select the dropdown at the top of the **Sprint** column.
    
- Then choose _Sort A to Z_ to group the Current Sprint items together. 
    
- Highlight the Current Sprint items, making sure to include all the cells from the **Epic** column to the **Sprint** column.
    
- Paste the cells into the **Sprint Backlog** tab. 
    
- The total number of Story Points from these items will appear in the **Sprints** section next to **Points Assigned**.  The total value will appear next to **Value Attributed**.
    

Check to make sure the number of Story points assigned fits the capacity for the Current Sprint. If the number is above or below capacity, try reassigning the Product Backlog items as needed. 

**Step 6: Assign remaining items to the next Sprint (Google Sheets and Excel versions)**

Go back to the **Product Backlo**g tab. For any items that didn’t fit into the Current Sprint, select _Next Sprint_ from the dropdown. 

Keep in mind that there is more than one right way to build a Backlog. There could be project needs or dependencies that cause the Product Owner to make adjustments. Your team will continue to iterate and complete Sprint Planning throughout the life cycle of the project.

Compare the exemplars to your completed activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar above. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers and the answers to the following questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

- Are there Backlog items assigned to the Current Sprint? 
    
- Are all extra Backlog items assigned to the Next Sprint? 
    
- Does the sum of the Current Sprint’s Story Points fit the team’s capacity? 
    
- Is the value attributed to the Current Sprint greater than the value attributed to the Next Sprint? 
    

**Note:** _The exemplar represents one possible way to complete the activity. Your work will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that your finished product is an example of a sprint backlog._
