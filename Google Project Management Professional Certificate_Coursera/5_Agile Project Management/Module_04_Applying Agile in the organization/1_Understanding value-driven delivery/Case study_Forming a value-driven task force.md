In the previous video, you learned that value-driven delivery is critical to Agile and Scrum project management. In this reading, you will read a case study and analyze how Agile brought value to the organization. 

## **Learning from case studies**

As you pursue your career in project management, you will come across many resources for learning about other companies and their journeys to becoming Agile. 

**Case studies**—in-depth, data-driven analyses of a business, community, or organization—are valuable tools for gaining key industry insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors. 

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.

As you read, ask yourself: 

- What is the issue?
    
- What is the goal of the analysis?
    
- What is the context of the problem?
    
- What key facts should be considered?
    
- What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
    
- What would you recommend, and why?
    

## **Value-driven delivery at Penta**

The case study linked below is about how the team at Penta, a construction software company, created **scrum-team-based problem solving** by forming an Agile task force. 

Keep the questions above in mind as you read through the case study. Notice how the various roles and responsibilities were essential to the process and how the company brought people from across the organization together to ideate, test, and analyze. 

When you are finished, think about how Scrum and Agile principles benefitted Penta and how it improved their overall business model.
