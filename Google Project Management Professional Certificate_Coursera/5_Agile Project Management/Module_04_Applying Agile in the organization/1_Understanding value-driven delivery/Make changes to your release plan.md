Compare the exemplar to your completed emails. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

_**Note:**_ _Your responses may differ, depending on your chosen approach._

Let’s review the exemplar emails:

**Email 1: June seasonal care emails completed**

Sometimes change is good! The Content Manager emailed to say that they were able to complete their tasks early. This change would not affect the release plan—you wouldn’t want to move the release earlier, because there are other workflows and timelines to consider—but this means that these items are complete.

**Email 2: New vendor management system issues**

The Vendor Manager alerted you to an issue with the vendor database, which is causing inventory discrepancies and missing invoices. This issue will impact customer orders. 

First, you think of ways your team might fix the problem without causing delays (like repairing the system quickly, manually tracking orders or going back to the old software). 

You want to talk to the Vendor manager to get more details, your Developers and the IT team (about fixing the issue), and the Warehouse Manager (who may need to coordinate manual inventory tracking). 

Finally, the email to the team lets them know about the issue. Since it’s still a few weeks until the next release, it’s likely they can fix the issue in time. 

**Email 3: We lost our Bonsai supplier**

The Vendor Manager also alerted you that the Bonsai tree supplier will stop carrying Bonsai trees at the end of the month. Since this will impact the ability to fill Bonsai orders, finding a solution is imperative.

The team can try to source Bonsai trees elsewhere, but if that doesn’t happen quickly, you may need to remove them from the website and/or replace them with different plants.

Since this is a major issue, the Product Owner should be involved in the discussion. The Vendor Manager can help you find another supplier (including information on costs and shipping schedules). You also need to touch base with your Development team, as they may need to make changes to the site. 

Finally, the email to the team lets them know about the issue, outlines its potential impact, and proposes some possible solutions.
