### Outline: Related Areas of Project Management – Program Management

**Introduction**

- Reference to earlier course example: building a skyscraper
    
- Skyscraper as a project vs. program
    

**Project vs. Program**

- A skyscraper can be seen as a single project (very large)
    
- More likely, a skyscraper is managed as a **program**
    
- Program = multiple related projects managed together for benefits not achievable if projects are managed independently
    

**Program Management Explanation**

- Coordination among multiple projects within the program
    
- Example: coordinating materials delivery, job site logistics, resource management (e.g., electricians)
    
- Program manager works with project managers to orchestrate all related projects
    

**Key Concept: Orchestration**

- Program management involves scheduling, coordinating, and logistics across projects
    
- Enables smoother work and resource sharing
    

**Relationship between Projects and Programs**

- Programs contain multiple projects
    
- There are project managers and program managers
    
- Program management is a related but distinct area of project management
    

**Certification**

- PMI offers Program Management Professional (PgMP) certification
    
- PgMP is challenging and rare globally
    
- Important to recognize and understand the concept of programs having projects
    

**Closing**

- Encouragement to keep learning and progressing

# Portfolio Management Overview

### 1. Definition of Portfolio

- A portfolio is like a "book" of all investments an organization makes.
    
- Includes investments in **projects, programs, and sometimes operations**.
    
- Personal portfolio example: stocks, savings, etc.
    
- Business portfolio: investments in programs, projects, operations.
    

### 2. Portfolio Management

- Managed by a **portfolio manager**, usually a senior executive.
    
- Responsible for deciding **where and how to invest** in programs and projects.
    

### 3. Key Considerations in Portfolio Management

- **Scope**: What will be delivered for the organization? Focus on business value.
    
- **Change**: Are you moving from a current state to a desired future state? What changes?
    
- **Planning**: How will the work be planned and executed efficiently and effectively?
    
- **Management**: Who manages the projects/programs?
    
- **Success Factors**: How do you define and measure success?
    
- **Monitoring**: How do you monitor progress, risks, and potential threats to success?
    

### 4. Investment Focus

- Portfolio aims to maximize **return on investment (ROI)**.
    
- The portfolio manager tracks how investments deliver value.
    

### 5. Portfolio Structure

- Portfolio includes both:
    
    - **Programs** (which contain projects)
        
    - **Projects** (standalone or within programs)
        
- Sometimes portfolios may have:
    
    - Only programs
        
    - Only projects
        
    - Or a combination of both
        

### 6. Oversight Responsibilities of Portfolio Management

- Manage scope, change, planning, and success measurement.
    
- Monitor performance and communicate variances or deviations from plan.
    
- Communication about project status and risks is important (covered in PMBOK Chapter 10).
    

### 7. Organizational Portfolio and Sub-Portfolios

- Large organizations may have:
    
    - A main portfolio covering entire business investments.
        
    - **Sub-portfolios** for different departments, business lines, or project types.
        
- Sub-portfolios are smaller segments under the main portfolio umbrella.
    

### 8. Inclusion of Operations

- While portfolios focus on projects and programs, **operations can also be part of the portfolio**.

Sure! Here's a clean, structured outline based on the transcript you shared about Organizational Project Management (OPM):

# Organizational Project Management (OPM) Outline

### 1. Introduction to OPM

- Many organizations desire uniformity in project management.
    
- Uniformity includes processes, terminology, and stakeholder expectations.
    
- Organizational Project Management (OPM) is the coordination and management of projects and programs consistently across an organization.
    
- OPM sometimes referred to as the Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3).
    
- Purpose: to manage portfolios, programs, and projects uniformly to deliver better, consistent results.
    

### 2. Challenges Without OPM

- Different project managers may use different methodologies (Lean, Agile, Predictive).
    
- Different forms and approaches cause confusion among stakeholders and customers.
    
- Lack of uniformity creates inefficiencies and communication problems.
    

### 3. Benefits of OPM

- Consistent decision-making at executive levels on project management approaches.
    
- Tailored but uniform approaches make it easier for the organization.
    
- Leads to better project delivery and stakeholder satisfaction.
    

### 4. Key Concepts and Goals of OPM

- **Goals and Tactics:** Understanding why projects are undertaken and their alignment with business goals.
    
- **Value Decisions:** How projects create business value and benefit stakeholders.
    
- **Results Delivery:** Selecting the best approach to efficiently deliver project outcomes (profit, value, ROI).
    
- **Business Value Realization:** Measuring and realizing the value and returns after project completion (market share, stakeholder happiness).
    

### 5. Relationship Between Projects and Strategic Planning

- Most organizations have a hierarchical structure:
    
    - Executives (top)
        
    - Functional Management (middle)
        
    - Operations (broad base)
        
- Each level has different perspectives on projects:
    
    - **Executives:** Why do this project? How does it support vision, mission, and goals?
        
    - **Functional Management:** What are the mechanics and tactics to support strategy?
        
    - **Operations:** How will the project be implemented daily to meet goals?
        

### 6. Project Lifecycle Across Levels

- Start broad with project charter (why).
    
- Define scope and plan (what).
    
- Work with teams and experts on execution (how).
    
- Ensure strategies support vision and goals.
