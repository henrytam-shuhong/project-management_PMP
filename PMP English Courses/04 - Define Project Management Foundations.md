### **Lecture Topic: The Temporary Nature of Projects**

#### **1. Introduction**

- Projects are temporary endeavors.
    
- Temporary does **not** mean short-term — duration can vary.
    

#### **2. Characteristics of Projects**

- Projects have:
    
    - A definite **beginning** and **end**.
        
    - Clearly defined **success criteria** (outlined in the project charter).
        

#### **3. Indicators a Project Has Ended**

- Objectives are met:
    
    - Could be **scope**, **time**, or **cost** related.
        
    - Example: Finishing before a trade show deadline — if missed, project ends.
        
- Budget exhausted: prioritize tasks, stop when funds run out.
    

#### **4. Situations Leading to Early Project Termination**



- **Redundancy or obsolescence**:
    
    - A new version (e.g., software 2.0) makes the current one unnecessary.
        
    - Market opportunity disappears.
        
- **Loss of key resources**:
    
    - Team member with unique skills leaves.
        
    - Essential material becomes unavailable.
        
- **Legal or regulatory issues**:
    
    - New laws may force project to stop.
        
- **Convenience**:
    
    - Decision to end the project simply because it’s been long enough.
        

#### **5. Key Takeaway**

- Projects are **not operations** (which are ongoing).
    
- Recognizing the **temporary nature** is crucial for proper management.
    
- Often, there's relief in knowing a project will eventually end.

### **Lecture Outline: Projects and Driving Change**

**1. Introduction**

- Brief welcoming tone with bright intro music.
    

**2. What is a Project?**

- A project is a **temporary endeavor** to create a **unique product, service, or result**.
    
- Core feature: **Projects drive change**.
    

**3. The Nature of Change in Projects**

- Projects involve movement from a **current state** to a **desired future state**.
    
- Change implies action toward defined goals.
    

**4. The Four Core Change Activities (MACD)**

- Projects involve one or more of the following:
    
    - **Moving** something
        
    - **Adding** something
        
    - **Changing** something
        
    - **Deleting** something
        
- Mnemonic: **MACD**
    
    - (Humorous suggestion to use hand gestures for each action.)
        

**5. Quick Test for Project Validation**

- Ask: “Are we **changing** anything?”
    
- If yes → it’s likely a project.
    

**6. Transition State in Change**

- Transition state often necessary, especially in IT.
    
    - Example: Upgrading from **Windows X to Windows Y**
        
        - Not all users switch at once.
            
        - Results in **dual support**: managing both old and new systems simultaneously.
            
        - This introduces risks and **resource challenges**.
            

**7. Broader Examples of Transition States**

- Not limited to IT:
    
    - Could involve **equipment**, **buildings**, or **solutions**.
        
- Includes **warranty periods**, **operational transfer**, and **support ramp-up**.
    
- Importance of **support and maintenance** during transition.
    

**8. Conclusion**

- Transition state is a crucial consideration in managing change through projects.
    
- Ends with encouragement and transition to the next lecture.

### **1. Introduction**

- Recap of previous assignment: Defining what a project is.
    
- Transition: Now discussing the concept of **project management**.
    

---

### **2. Defining Project Management**

- Common confusion around the term “project manager.”
    
- Simple definition:
    
    - A **project manager** manages change in an organization—from current to future state.
        
    - Involves coordinating all the logistics and affected areas.
        
- **PMI exam definition**:
    
    - Project management = application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet project requirements.
        

---

### **3. House-Building Analogy**

- Example to explain what a project manager does:
    
    - Client has a vision (e.g., building a house).
        
    - PM must:
        
        - Extract and understand requirements.
            
        - Handle logistics: permits, blueprints, skilled labor (foundation, framing, electrical, etc.).
            
        - Coordinate parts to be cost-effective and profitable.
            
        - Ensure final product meets expectations.
            

---

### **4. PM Processes**

- PMBOK Guide includes **49 project management processes**.
    
    - Grouped into:
        
        - **Initiating**
            
        - **Planning**
            
        - **Executing**
            
        - **Monitoring and Controlling**
            
        - **Closing**
            
- Not all processes are required in every project.
    
    - Example: No need for procurement process if no purchases.
        
    - Example: Skip quantitative risk analysis in low-priority projects.
        

---

### **5. Core Responsibilities of Project Management**

- **Identifying Requirements**
    
    - Understand what the client wants.
        
- **Managing Expectations and Concerns**
    
    - Example: Client expects a filled pool, but it’s not included in the project.
        
- **Communication**
    
    - PM’s main task: ensuring clear, continuous communication.
        
- **Stakeholder Management**
    
    - Stakeholders include more than just the main client (e.g., city officials, contractors, neighbors).
