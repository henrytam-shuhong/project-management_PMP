1. **Introduction to Tailoring**
    
    - New feature in PMBOK Guide Sixth Edition.
        
    - Tailoring means adapting processes based on project needs.
        
    - Example: Low-priority projects require less rigorous processes than high-profile projects.
        
2. **Concept of Tailoring**
    
    - Use only necessary processes.
        
    - Determine the depth/extent of each process based on project specifics.
        
    - Tailoring applies across all knowledge areas in PMBOK.
        
3. **Governance Considerations**
    
    - Enterprise or program governance rules must be followed.
        
    - Organizational requirements may dictate how extensively processes are executed.
        
    - PMO (Project Management Office) may impose best practices and controls.
        
4. **Tailoring in Project Integration Management**
    
    - Tailor processes according to:
        
        - Project life cycle.

Sure! Here’s a concise outline based on the transcript you provided, focused on **Project Selection and Decision-Making for Project Managers**:

---

# Project Selection and Decision-Making Outline

### 1. Introduction

- Project managers often **do not decide which projects to pursue**.
    
- Project selection decisions typically happen **outside the PM’s authority**.
    
- Sometimes PMs are asked to participate in the project selection process.
    

### 2. Reasons for Project Selection

- Solving a problem or **seizing an opportunity**.
    
- Responding to **marketplace needs or customer requests**.
    
- Addressing **organizational issues, product, or process problems**.
    
- Internal customer requests for solutions.
    

### 3. Approaches to Choosing Projects

- Organizations use different tools and criteria to **compare and select projects**.
    

### 4. Benefits Measurement

- Tool to **compare benefits across multiple projects**.
    
- Focus on **cost-benefit ratio (CBR)** — projects where benefits exceed costs are favored.
    

### 5. Scoring Models

- Assign scores based on factors like:
    
    - Cost
        
    - Schedule
        
    - Benefits
        
    - References (e.g., vendor reliability)
        
- Example: Project B scoring high in cost efficiency, schedule, and benefits.
    
- Can be applied to **vendor selection in procurement** as well.
    

### 6. Murder Board

- Intense review process where project sponsor faces a panel of executives.
    
- Executives ask **all possible tough questions**.
    
- Purpose: decide whether to **approve or kill the project before initiation**.
    
- Known for its grueling and rigorous nature.
    

### 7. Payback Period

- Time taken to **recover the initial investment** in the project.
    
- Example: If a $100,000 investment breaks even in six months, payback period = six months.
    
- Sometimes called the **management horizon**.
    

### 8. Time Value of Money

- Key formulas PMs should know relate to money’s changing value over time.
    
- **Future value**: what a present amount will be worth in the future.
    
- Important for comparing investment options:
    
    - Whether to invest in Project A or B
        
    - Or put money into the stock market or savings account

    - Organizational Process Assets (OPA)
        
- **Tools & Techniques:**
    
    - Expert judgment
        
    - Data gathering methods (brainstorming, checklists, focus groups, interviews)
        
    - Interpersonal and team skills (conflict management, facilitation, meeting management)
        
    - Meetings
        

**4. Output**

- The single output is the **Project Management Plan** document.
    

**5. Purpose of the Project Management Plan**

- A **fluid**, living document updated throughout the project.
    
- Describes:
    
    - How the project will be executed
        
    - How monitoring and controlling will be done
        
    - How phases and the project will be closed
        
- Acts as a guide and prediction for project execution.

**7. Establishing the Baseline**

- Once the plan is approved, it is **baselined** — a locked-in version of the project plan representing current intent.
    
- Any changes after baselining require **formal change requests** via change control.
    

**8. Importance of Change Control**

- Changes to the approved plan must go through a formal change request process to maintain control and agreement.
    

**9. Purpose of the Plan Recap**

- Communicates intent
    
- Serves as a guide for project managers
    
- Refreshes memories and directs work
    
- Provides structure

If you'd like, I can also help create a more detailed study guide or flashcards from this!


Here’s a structured **outline** of the video content you provided, organized by key themes and concepts in project management:

---

### **Outline: Understanding Deliverables and Change Control in Projects**

#### **I. Introduction**

- Opening music and introduction to project outputs.
    

---

#### **II. What Are Deliverables?**

- Definition: Anything created during the project that is **unique and verifiable**.
    
- Types of deliverables:
    
    - Tangible: e.g., **blueprints**, **devices**, **equipment**.
        
    - Intangible: e.g., **project management documents** like the **quality management plan**.
        
- Note: Some deliverables are for internal use only and not delivered to the customer.
    

---

#### **III. Change Control Process**

- Triggered once the **first version** of a deliverable exists.
    
- Any change after the initial version requires **change control**.
    
- Example: Modifying blueprints requires tracking changes.
    

---

#### **IV. Configuration Management**

- Definition: Managing **multiple versions** of a deliverable to ensure consistency.
    
- Example:
    
    - Blueprint versions: v1.0 → v1.1 → v2.0, etc.
        
    - Used to track adjustments like room size or HVAC placement.
        
- Purpose: Ensures everyone uses the **most current version**.
    

---

#### **V. Scope Validation and Formal Change Requests**

- Once a deliverable is **approved**, any changes require a **formal change request**.
    
- Example scenario:
    
    - House construction:
        
        - Framing completed.
            
        - Client requests additional space in the kitchen.
            
        - Must go through change control due to increased cost and time.
            

---

#### **VI. Impact of Changes**

- Changes after approval increase:
    
    - **Time**
        
    - **Cost**
        
    - **Effort**
        
- Even early-stage changes (e.g., after framing) incur costs due to rework.

**Course Introduction: CompTIA Network+ Certification**

- **Overview & Audience**
    
    - Designed as the foundational networking cert for IT/cybersecurity beginners.
        
    - Builds on—but does not reteach—CompTIA A+ (Core 1 & 2) assumed knowledge.
        
    - Suitable for those with <1 year IT experience or A+ certification holders.
        
    - Newcomers can still succeed with extra self-study.
        
- **Course Goals**
    
    - Teach you how to configure, manage, and troubleshoot enterprise network infrastructures.
        
    - Focus on practical skills: hardware, software, protocols, routing, switching, wireless, security, operations, and troubleshooting.
        
    - Act as a full textbook replacement (optionally supplement with the official CompTIA Network+ Student Guide).
        
- **Structure & Approach**
    
    - Organized into five exam domains (not covered strictly in numerical order):
        
        1. Networking Concepts (23% of exam)
            
        2. Network Implementation (20%)
            
        3. Network Operations (19%)
            
        4. Network Security (14%)
            
        5. Network Troubleshooting (24%)
            
    - Each section begins by identifying which CompTIA objectives and domains are addressed.
        
    - Teaches in a logical flow (e.g., fundamentals → cabling & wireless → switching & IP → cloud/virtualization → security → monitoring & disaster recovery → troubleshooting).

Here’s a clean, timestamp-free outline for **Perform Integrated Change Control**:

---

## Perform Integrated Change Control

1. **Purpose**
    
    - Central process for logging, evaluating, approving/deferring/rejecting changes
        
    - Ensures every change is assessed in terms of its impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, resources, etc.
        
2. **Inputs**
    
    - **Project Management Plan**
        
        - Scope, schedule & cost baselines
            
        - Configuration management plan
            
        - Change management plan (if separate)
            
        - Cost management plan
            
    - **Project Documents**
        
        - Basis of estimates (cost & time)
            
        - Requirements traceability matrix
            
        - Risk report
            
        - Work performance reports
            
    - **Change Requests** (initial submissions)
        
    - **EEFs & OPAs** (policies, historical data)
        
3. **Tools & Techniques**
    
    - **Expert Judgment** (PM, SMEs, functional managers)
        
    - **Change Control Tools** (workflow systems, logs)
        
    - **Data Analysis**
        
        - Alternative analysis
            
        - Cost–benefit analysis
            
    - **Decision Making**
        
        - Voting (unanimous, majority, plurality)
            
        - Autocratic decisions
            
        - Multi-criteria decision analysis
            
    - **Meetings** (change control board sessions)
        
4. **Outputs**
    
    - **Approved Change Requests** (enter execution)
        
    - **Change Log** (records all requests & their disposition)
        
    - **Project Management Plan Updates** (baselines & subsidiary plans)
        
    - **Project Document Updates** (e.g. requirements docs, risk register)
        
5. **Key Concepts**
    
    - **Baseline Protection**: Any change to scope/schedule/cost/plan requires formal change control
        
    - **Configuration Control**: Changes to the product’s features/functions go through the configuration management system (identify, status accounting, verify/audit)
        
    - **Uncontrolled Changes**
        
        - **Scope Creep**: “Small” unauthorized tweaks that bypass controls
            
        - **Gold Plating**: Adding extras at end of project simply to spend leftover budget
            
    - **Change Approval Levels**: Pre-defined thresholds (e.g. cost > $10 K or duration > 2 weeks) dictating who must approve
        
6. **Workflow Overview**
    
    1. **Submit Change Request** (any stakeholder)
        
    2. **Intake/Logging** in change management system
        
    3. **Configuration Check**: If product features/functions are affected, engage configuration management
        
    4. **Impact Analysis** via integrated change control (consider all knowledge areas)
        
    5. **Decision** by PM / Change Control Board (approve, defer, reject)
        
    6. **Implement** approved changes, update plans & docs, track execution & validation
        

---

Mastering this end-to-end flow—and the distinctions between deferral, rejection, scope creep, gold plating, and formal approvals—is critical for both PMI’s exam and real-world project governance.

    - Financial closure: settle all accounts, invoices, POs
        
    - Release/reassign staff, facilities, equipment, excess materials
        
6. **Contract Closure**
    
    - Confirm all parties have fulfilled contractual obligations
        
    - Resolve or document any open claims
        
    - Archive procurement files for future reference
        
7. **Key Closing Activities**
    
    - Generate final project report (performance vs. baselines, quality, scope, cost, schedule, risks, business objectives)
        
    - Capture and share lessons learned
        
    - Measure stakeholder satisfaction (surveys, interviews)
