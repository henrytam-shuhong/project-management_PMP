### Lecture Outline: Work Performance Data, Information, and Reports

1. **Introduction**
    
    - Welcome back and review of the importance of an earlier assignment.
        
    - Introduction of three key terms for the course:
        
        - Work Performance Data
            
        - Work Performance Information
            
        - Work Performance Reports
            
2. **Overview**
    
    - These three terms appear across all project management knowledge areas.
        
    - They serve as inputs and outputs in processes.
        
3. **Work Performance Data**
    
    - Definition: Raw, unprocessed facts about project work.
        
    - Examples:
        
        - Percent complete of activities
            
        - Number of activities not started or in progress
            
        - Planned vs. actual start and finish dates
            
        - Cost of activities, number of change requests, defects, durations
            
    - Source:
        
        - Status meetings, work authorization systems, team communications
            
    - Characteristics:
        
        - Raw, not yet analyzed or useful alone
            
4. **Work Performance Information**
    
    - Definition: Analyzed and processed work performance data.
        
    - Transformation from data into meaningful information.
        
    - Used for decision making and actionable insights.
        
    - Example: Current project status based on analyzed data.
        
5. **Work Performance Reports**
    
    - Definition: Packaged and formatted work performance information for communication.
        
    - Formats:
        
        - Status reports, memos, dashboards, weekly project updates
            
        - Could include exception reports, variance reports, risk reports
            
    - Purpose: To clearly communicate the status and insights.
        
6. **Summary / Memory Aid**
    
    - Alphabetical order helps remember the flow:
        
        - Data → Information → Reports
            
    - Process: Collect raw data → analyze into information → communicate via reports
        
7. **Closing**
    
    - Mastery of the three terms is crucial for the course.
        
    - Encouragement to keep progressing.

Sure! Here’s a clean, concise outline based on your transcript about tailoring project management processes:

---

### Outline: Tailoring Project Management Processes

**1. Introduction to Tailoring**

- Not all processes are used on every project.
    
- Need to decide which processes to use and their depth of application.
    
- Tailor processes to fit project type, organizational needs, and priorities.
    

**2. Four Key Questions for Tailoring**

- **Which processes to use?**  
    Select relevant processes for the project, not all processes are required.
    
- **To what depth?**  
    Determine the extent and intensity of applying each process.
    
    - Larger, high-profile projects require deeper, more detailed processes.
        
    - Smaller, low-priority projects can use a high-level, simplified approach.
        
- **Not every process is needed for every project.**
    
- **Project size impacts process coverage:**  
    Larger projects likely require more processes.
    

**3. Tailoring in the PMBOK Guide**

- Tailoring applies across all knowledge areas (Integration, Stakeholder Management, etc.).
    
- Processes exist within knowledge areas.
    
- Tailoring decisions depend on:
    
    - Project characteristics and priorities.
        
    - Which processes are necessary and to what extent.
        
- Tailoring is a recurring theme throughout the PMBOK chapters.
    

**4. Summary**

- Tailoring is essential for project efficiency and relevance.
    
- Each knowledge area and process can be tailored to suit the project’s needs.
    
- Awareness of tailoring throughout project management is key.

Sure! Here’s a concise outline summarizing the key points from your transcript about project life cycles and adaptive vs. predictive approaches:

---

### Outline: Project Life Cycles & Adaptive vs. Predictive Approaches

#### 1. Introduction to Project Life Cycle & Project Management Life Cycle

- Project life cycle overview
    
- Project management life cycle phases:
    
    - Initiating
        
    - Planning
        
    - Executing
        
    - Monitoring & Controlling
        
    - Closing
        

#### 2. Overlap Between Project Life Cycle & Management Life Cycle

- Planning and delivery overlap
    
- PBO Guide Sixth Edition introduces:
    
    - Predictive life cycles
        
    - Adaptive life cycles
        

#### 3. Predictive Life Cycle (Waterfall Approach)

- Typical in construction projects (plan-driven)
    
- Most requirements known upfront
    
- Clear phases from start to finish (foundation to project close)
    
- Changes to scope tightly controlled (change-averse)
    
- Work flows linearly, phase by phase, like a waterfall
    

#### 4. Adaptive Life Cycles: Iterative and Incremental

- Phases repeated through iterations
    
- Iterations produce deliverables
    
- Changes expected during the process
    

##### Difference Between Iterative and Incremental:

- **Iterative**: cycles repeated to refine the product
    
- **Incremental**: deliverables provided in pieces/increments (e.g., add features step by step)
    

#### 5. Adaptive Life Cycle Applications

- Often used in Agile frameworks like Scrum, XP, Lean
    
- Kanban boards illustrate workflow:
    
    - Stories (requirements) move through stages: backlog, in progress, testing, done
        
- Adaptive life cycles are change-driven, less upfront certainty
    

#### 6. Product Backlog & Prioritization in Adaptive Environment

- Product backlog contains prioritized requirements
    
- Product owner prioritizes with team
    
- Work done in iterations/sprints (typically 2-4 weeks)

1. **Introduction to Business Documents**
    
    - Definition: Inputs to project processes, sometimes updated
        
    - Examples: Project business case, project charter, project management plan, benefits management plan
        
    - Role: Attached to or affect various project elements throughout the project lifecycle
        
2. **Business Documents for Project Performance**
    
    - Phase gates: Reviews at the end of each project phase before moving to the next
        
    - Phase gate purpose: Ensure previous phase is 100% complete, financially accounted for, and signed off
        
3. **Phase Gate Details**
    
    - Review elements: Planned spend, phase completion time, deliverables
        
    - Business documents tied to phase gates for performance measurement
        
4. **Actual Performance vs. Estimates**
    
    - Cost and schedule estimates compared to actuals
        
    - Use of exception/variance reports to explain deviations (e.g., late, over budget)
        
    - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) monitoring
        
5. **Decisions at Phase Gates (Kill Points)**
    
    - Possibility to kill (cancel) the project based on performance criteria
        
    - Example rules:
        
        - > 30% over budget → cancel
            
        - Too many days late → cancel
            
    - Alternatives:
        
        - Continue with scope modifications (trim scope/time)
            
        - Continue normally if successful
            
6. **Possible Outcomes at Phase Gates**
    
    - Move to next phase
        
    - Stay in current phase to complete scope
        
    - Repeat phase or parts due to quality issues
        
7. **Summary**
    
    - Business documents include feasibility, business case, project documents, estimates
        
    - They guide project progress and phase completion expectations
