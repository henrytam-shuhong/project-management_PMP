Here’s a clear outline summary of the video transcript about **parametric estimating**:

---

### Outline: Parametric Estimating

1. **Definition and Basic Concept**
    
    - Parametric estimating uses a parameter (e.g., cost per unit) multiplied by quantity
        
    - Example: $100 per square foot → total cost depends on total square feet
        
    - It’s a mathematical forecasting model based on measurable parameters
        
2. **Examples of Parameters**
    
    - Cost per cubic yard
        
    - Cost per unit
        
    - Cost per software license
        
    - Parameters can vary depending on the type of work
        
3. **More Complex Models**
    
    - Cost per unit plus adjustment factors (e.g., delivery cost based on distance)
        
    - Example: $28 per square foot construction cost that varies if materials change
        
4. **Additional Parametric Estimating Concepts**
    
    - **Regression Analysis:**
        
        - Statistical method using historical data variables
            
        - Identifies which variables most influence cost
            
        - Helps predict current project cost from historical trends
            
    - **Learning Curve:**
        
        - Reflects efficiency improvements over time with repetitive tasks
            
        - Cost per unit decreases as work is repeated and becomes faster
            
        - Applicable only for repetitive activities
            
5. **Summary**
    
    - Parametric estimating is a mathematical, parameter-based forecasting method

### Outline: Three-Point Estimates and Cost Estimation Methods

1. **Introduction to Three-Point Estimates**
    
    - Definition: An average estimate of cost.
        
    - Reference to scheduling estimates: optimistic, most likely, pessimistic (triangular distribution).
        
    - Concept applies similarly to cost as to time estimates.
        
2. **Three-Point Estimate Example**
    
    - Example numbers: 25 + 45 + 75 hours averaging 48.33 hours.
        
    - Replace time with money for cost estimates (same calculation).
        
3. **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) for Cost**
    
    - Uses optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates in dollars.
        
    - Weighted formula: (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6.
        
    - Example: earlier hours estimate of 46.66 translates to $46.66 in cost.
        
4. **Notation and Signals**
    
    - Use of ‘c’ prefix to signal cost estimates.
        
    - Similar approach whether beta or triangular distributions used for time or cost.

    - PERT weighted average:
        
        - Calculation: (4,000 + 4×18,000 + 15,000) ÷ 6 = $8,500.
            
    - Weighted average skews closer to most likely estimate.
        
6. **Summary**
    
    - Comparison of three-point and PERT methods.
        
    - Both work the same way for time or money.
        
7. **Data Analysis and Cost Saving**
    
    - Review alternatives to reduce costs.
        
    - Use reserve analysis to manage funds for risks.
        
8. **Reserve Analysis**
    
    - Reserves are funds set aside for known and unknown risks.
        
    - Early use of reserves reduces safety net for later risks.
        
    - Importance of identifying and managing risks early to avoid reserve depletion.
        
9. **Cost of Quality (preview for next chapter)**
    
    - Includes costs for training, tools, equipment, resources to ensure quality.

Here’s a clean outline summary of your video transcript on **Determining the Project Budget** for cost management:

---

### Outline: Determine Budget (Project Cost Management)

#### 1. Introduction to Determining Budget

- After estimating costs, the next step is determining the budget.
    
- Determining the budget means aggregating estimated costs to form the total project budget.
    
- Budget is the authorized cost baseline (funds allocated for project work).
    
- Budget excludes management reserves but includes contingency reserves (for risk).
    

#### 2. Inputs (ITTOs) for Determining Budget

- **Project Management Plan:** cost management plan, resource management plan
    
- **Scope Baseline**
    
- **Project Documents:** basis of estimates, cost estimates, project schedule, risk register
    
- **Business Documents:** business case, benefits management plan
    
- **Agreements:** contracts, enterprise environmental factors (EEF), organizational process assets (OPA)
    

#### 3. Tools and Techniques

- Expert judgment
    
- Cost aggregation (combining individual cost estimates)
    
- Data analysis
    
- Reserve analysis (contingency planning)
    
- Historical information review
    
- Funding limit reconciliation (matching planned and actual funding)
    
- Financing (actual money flow)
    

#### 4. Outputs

- Cost baseline
    
- Project funding requirements
    
- Updated project documents (cost estimates, schedule, risk register)
    

#### 5. Key Exam Points

- Cost estimating happens before budgeting.
    
- Budget created based on reliable cost estimates.
    
- Budget represents actual funds committed to project activities.
    
- Preassigned budgets may act as constraints or risks if unrealistic.
    
- Mismatches between scope and budget present risks.
    

#### 6. Using Historical Data for Estimates

- Parametric and analogous estimating use historical data.
    
- Parametric estimating relies on quantifiable, repeatable parameters (e.g., cost per unit).
    
- Accuracy depends on reliable, uniform historical data.
    
- Fluctuating or inconsistent units make parametric estimates unreliable.
    
- Models must be scalable and consistent regardless of quantity.
    

#### 7. Funding Limit Reconciliation

- Comparing planned cost and actual expenditures.
    
- Cost variance requires corrective actions: re-estimate, trim scope, or request more funds.
    

#### 8. Understanding Project Costs Over Time

- Actual project cost is only fully known after project completion.
    
- Cost curve vs. schedule timeline shows cumulative cost progression.

# Outline: Cost Baseline in Project Management

### 1. Introduction to Cost Baseline

- Definition: A cost baseline shows the predicted cost and timing of costs throughout a project.
    
- Purpose: Used to measure project performance by comparing predicted vs. actual costs.
    

### 2. Characteristics of Cost Baseline

- Predicts total project cost and expenses over the project lifecycle.
    
- Typically visualized as an S-curve.
    
    - The S-curve rises over time, with the top indicating the project’s completion (time and money spent).
        

### 3. Interpretation of Cost Baseline

- The curve shows when money will be spent during the project.
    
- Early discrepancies between predicted and actual costs can indicate budget issues or inaccurate baseline.
    
- Large projects may have multiple cost baselines for different phases.
    

### 4. Uses of Cost Baseline

- Helps predict spending plans including capital or large expenses.
    
- Tracks cash flow, showing when deliverables may bring cash back.
    
- Measures overall project cost performance.
    

### 5. Explanation of Typical Cost Baseline Chart

- Y-axis: Cumulative cost.
    
- X-axis: Time.
    
- Solid blue line: Predicted cost baseline.
    
- Red line: Actual cost incurred.
    
- Thin black line: Expected expenditures timeline.
    

### 6. Analyzing Variances in Cost Baseline

- Early project: Actual costs below baseline → slower spending or slower start.
    
- Later project: Actual costs rise above baseline → possible crash to meet deadlines or unexpected expenses.
    
- Observed variance indicates potential problems (e.g., waste, underestimated costs).
    

### 7. Conclusion

- The S-curve helps project managers monitor cost and timing.
    
- Significant deviations require investigation and corrective action.

    - Risk Register
        

#### **IV. Controlling Cost Activities**

1. **Influencing Factors:**
    
    - Vendors, teams, stakeholders – aim for accurate work to avoid rework.
        
    - Rework leads to wasted time and money due to poor quality.
        
2. **Managing Change Requests:**
    
    - Use integrated change control for cost-related changes.
        
    - Approved changes → re-baseline the budget.
        
    - Unapproved changes → logged in the change log (may still cause variance).
        
3. **Tracking Costs:**
    
    - Monitor when and where money is spent.
        
    - Evaluate return on investment.
        
4. **Isolating and Analyzing Variances:**
    
    - Break down the cause of variances (single issue or multiple small ones).
        
    - Determine if they are exceptions or recurring issues.
        
5. **Earned Value Management (EVM):**
    
    - Use EVM formulas to assess project performance in terms of cost and schedule.
        
6. **Reporting:**
    
    - Communicate cost status via:
        
        - Status Reports
            
        - Variance Reports
            
        - Exception Reports

This video transcript is a clear and structured walkthrough of **Earned Value Management (EVM)** — a project performance measurement technique widely used in project management. Here's a summary and explanation of the key concepts and formulas covered:

---

### **Key Terminology & Formulas**

1. **Budget at Completion (BAC)**
    
    - Total planned budget for the entire project.
        
    - **Example**: $250,000
        
2. **Percent Complete**
    
    - Current progress of the project.
        
    - **Example**: 40% done (actual), supposed to be 55% done.
        
3. **Actual Cost (AC)**
    
    - The real amount spent so far.
        
    - **Example**: $112,000
        
4. **Earned Value (EV)**
    
    - The value of work actually completed.
        
    - **Formula**: `EV = % Complete × BAC`
        
    - **Example**: 0.40 × 250,000 = **$100,000**
        
5. **Planned Value (PV)**
    
    - The value of work planned to be completed by this point.
        
    - **Formula**: `PV = % Planned × BAC`
        
    - **Example**: 0.55 × 250,000 = **$137,500**

### **Variance Calculations**

6. **Cost Variance (CV)**
    
    - Difference between earned value and actual cost.
        
    - **Formula**: `CV = EV - AC`
        
    - **Example**: 100,000 - 112,000 = **-12,000**
        
    - **Interpretation**: Over budget
        
7. **Schedule Variance (SV)**
    
    - Difference between earned value and planned value.
        
    - **Formula**: `SV = EV - PV`
        
    - **Example**: 100,000 - 137,500 = **-37,500**
        
    - **Interpretation**: Behind schedule

### **Performance Indexes**

8. **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**
    
    - Efficiency of cost usage.
        
    - **Formula**: `CPI = EV / AC`
        
    - **Example**: 100,000 / 112,000 ≈ **0.89**
        
    - **Interpretation**: For every $1 spent, only $0.89 of value is received
        
9. **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**
    
    - Efficiency of time usage.
        
    - **Formula**: `SPI = EV / PV`
        
    - **Example**: 100,000 / 137,500 ≈ **0.73**
        
    - **Interpretation**: 27% behind schedule
        

---

### **Forecasting**

10. **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**
    
    - Forecasted total project cost if current cost trends continue.
        
    - **Formula**: `EAC = BAC / CPI`
        
    - **Example**: 250,000 / 0.89 ≈ **$280,000**
        
11. **Estimate to Complete (ETC)**
    
    - How much more will be needed to finish the project.
        
    - **Formula**: `ETC = EAC - AC`
        
    - **Example**: 280,000 - 112,000 = **$168,000**
        

---

### **Summary of Performance**

- **Cost Overrun**: You're 12K over the value of work done so far.
    
- **Time Delay**: You're 27% behind schedule.
    
- **Prediction**: Project likely to end $30K over budget.
