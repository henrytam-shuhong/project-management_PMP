Here’s a structured outline summarizing the key points from your transcript about **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)**:

---

### Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) — Overview

- **Definition:**  
    Factors inside and outside an organization that influence how projects are managed.
    
    - They can affect projects **directly** (mandatory processes/forms) or **indirectly** (organization structure, team workflows).
        
- **Control:**  
    Project managers have **no control** over EEFs.
    

---

### Types of Enterprise Environmental Factors

#### 1. Internal Enterprise Environmental Factors

- Created by the organization but **outside the project** scope.
    
- Examples include:
    
    - Mandatory software tools (e.g., specific project management software).
        
    - Required communication protocols (e.g., weekly reports).
        
    - Organizational rules, policies, and procedures.
        
    - Organizational culture and structure.
        
    - Leadership style, vision, beliefs, and management hierarchy.
        
    - Ethics and organizational code of conduct.
        
    - Physical and human resource locations.
        
    - Logistics for equipment and materials.
        
    - Virtual or distributed teams requiring travel/coordination.
        
    - IT infrastructure (data access, security, printing).
        
    - Facilities and equipment management (check-in/check-out systems).
        
    - Configuration management of project outputs.
        
    - Work authorization and scheduling systems, especially in complex matrix organizations.
        
    - Resource availability and procurement processes.
        
    - Employee capabilities and training needs.
        

---

#### 2. External Enterprise Environmental Factors

- Outside the organization/company.
    
- Examples include:
    
    - Laws, regulations, and compliance requirements.
        
    - Market conditions (supply, demand, pricing).
        
    - Legal restrictions on suppliers or purchases across countries.
        
    - Security and encryption regulations by country.
        
    - Cultural influences and political climate.

Sure! Here's a concise outline summarizing the content of the transcript you shared, which explains **Organizational Process Assets (OPA)** in project management, contrasting them with **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)**:

---

## Outline: Organizational Process Assets (OPA) and Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)

### 1. Introduction to OPAs and EEFs

- EEFs and OPAs are common inputs to project management processes.
    
- OPAs are internal resources within an organization to support project success.
    

### 2. What are Organizational Process Assets?

- Resources created and maintained by the organization for reuse.
    
- Examples include:
    
    - Historical information (past project data, lessons learned)
        
    - Templates (scope templates, charter templates, quality plans)
        
    - Standards, policies, procedures
        
    - Guidelines on project management processes
        
    - Financial controls, procurement procedures, communication requirements
        

### 3. Historical Information as an OPA

- Proven data from past projects used to guide current projects.
    
- Saves time by adapting existing documents instead of starting from scratch.
    

### 4. Difference between OPAs and EEFs

- Policies and standards can be both OPAs and EEFs depending on context.
    
- EEFs generally **restrict or constrain** project options (mandatory rules).
    
- OPAs generally **help or facilitate** project execution (resources to leverage).
    
- Example: Policies that must be followed = EEFs; templates and guidelines provided to help = OPAs.
    

### 5. Adaptation and Customization

- OPAs are not one-size-fits-all; they need to be adapted to specific organizations and projects.
    
- PMI provides templates and forms but they require customization to fit the organization’s needs.
    

### 6. Common Examples of OPAs

- Standards, policies, organizational procedures
    
- Financial controls and purchasing processes
    
- Communication forms, reports, and procedures
    
- Change control and project closure processes
    

### 7. Practical Advice

- Use historical information as templates to work smarter.
    
- Understand the distinction between constraints (EEF) and resources (OPA).
    
- Adapt OPAs to fit your unique organizational environment and project requirements.

- Large organizations replicate roles.
    
- Project Manager (PM) has limited authority.
    
- PM role might be called Project Coordinator.
    
- Resources typically part-time; participants also do day-to-day tasks.
    
- Possible part-time admin or scribe to assist with scheduling, minutes, agendas.
    
- Functional manager controls project budget.
    

#### 2. Matrix Organizational Structures

- Types: Weak, Balanced, Strong
    
- Teams draw resources from across departments (manufacturing, finance, IT, etc.), often globally.
    

##### a. Weak Matrix

- PM has very little authority.
    
- PM and team typically part-time.
    
- PM may be called Project Coordinator or Team Lead.
    
- Functional manager manages budget.
    
- Admin support often part-time.
    

##### b. Balanced Matrix

- Authority shared between PM and Functional Manager.
    
- Low to moderate PM authority.
    
- Both PM and team usually part-time.
    
- Power struggles possible over budget management.
    
- Shared control of project budget.
    

##### c. Strong Matrix

- PM has moderate to high authority, especially over budget.
    
- PM role may be full-time.
    
- Team ranges from part-time to nearly full-time.
    
- Full-time administrative staff may support.
    
- Focus more on projects and PM authority.

- PM has close to full control and high autonomy.
    
- PM and team work full-time on the project.
    
- Full-time admin support, including schedulers or risk managers.
    
- PM manages project budget fully.
    

#### 4. Virtual Organization

- Involves multiple departments with one representative per department.
    
- Functions like a network with each "node" as a point of contact.
    
- Communication challenges due to information passing through these points.
    
- PM has low authority; shares authority with functional managers.
    
- PM can be full-time or part-time.
    
- Team members usually part-time.
    
- Administrative staff may be full-time or part-time.

Here’s a clear outline of the content about building momentum for PMP exam study:

---

### Building Momentum for PMP Exam Study

1. **Importance of Momentum**
    
    - Momentum is the energy that keeps you moving forward.
        
    - The hardest part is starting; once started, momentum helps sustain progress.
        
2. **Consistency in Study**
    
    - Find daily time to study for the PMP exam.
        
    - Keep the momentum going with regular involvement.
        
3. **Big Picture Perspective**
    
    - Studying for the PMP exam is a temporary effort, like a project with an end date.
        
    - Avoid stretching the study period too long (e.g., a whole year) as it leads to loss of information retention.
